# RuleBuilder

I thought it would be a fun, if not instructive, exercise to apply flux/react concepts to the domain of a rule builder.  


The backend is ASP.NET MVC +  RavenDB,  but most of the interesting stuff is happening on the client side:

<ul>
<li>React</li>
<li>React-Bootstrap</li>
<li>Flux</li>
<li>Gulp</li>
<li>CommonJS</li>
</ul>
